1. What is Playwright?

open-source automation library for testing web applications. Developed by Microsoft

Key features :

Cross-browser support: Run tests in multiple browsers with a single API.
Auto-waiting: Automatically waits for elements to be ready before executing actions, which reduces flakiness in tests.
Headless mode: Supports running tests without a UI, making it faster and more efficient for CI/CD pipelines.
Mobile emulation: Simulates mobile devices for testing responsive designs.
Rich API: Offers a wide range of functions for interacting with pages, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and taking screenshots.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How does Playwright differ from Selenium?

1. Architecture
Playwright: Built from the ground up to support modern web applications, Playwright uses browser-specific protocols (like DevTools Protocol) for direct communication, resulting in faster execution.
Selenium: Works with a WebDriver protocol that communicates with browsers. While widely supported, it can be slower due to this additional layer.

2. Browser Support
Playwright: Supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge out of the box, including their respective headless modes. It also provides mobile device emulation.
Selenium: Also supports multiple browsers but may require additional setup for certain browsers or versions.

3. Auto-Waiting
Playwright: Automatically waits for elements to be ready (e.g., visible, attached to the DOM) before interacting with them, which reduces flakiness in tests.
Selenium: Requires explicit waits (e.g., WebDriverWait) for similar behavior, which can lead to more complex code.

4. Cross-Browser Testing
Playwright: Designed for parallel execution and can easily run tests across different browsers with minimal configuration.
Selenium: Supports cross-browser testing but can require more setup and configuration.

5. API Design
Playwright: Offers a modern, promise-based API that is easier to work with and integrates well with async programming.
Selenium: The API is more traditional and can be less intuitive for handling asynchronous operations.

6. Mobile Testing
Playwright: Has built-in support for mobile emulation and testing, making it easier to test responsive designs.
Selenium: Mobile testing can be more complex and often requires integration with additional tools like Appium.

7. Community and Ecosystem
Playwright: A newer tool with growing popularity and a rapidly expanding ecosystem.
Selenium: A well-established tool with a large community, extensive documentation, and a wide range of plugins.

3.  What are the primary components of Playwright?

1. Browser Context
2. Pages
3. Selectors
4. Devices
5. Network Interception
6. Test Runner
7. Trace Viewer
8. API for Interactions
9. Geolocation and Permissions
10. Multiple Browsers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.What is a BrowserContext in Playwright?

const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const context = await browser.newContext(); // Create a new context
    const page = await context.newPage(); // Create a new page within the context

    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    // Add your testing code here

    await context.close(); // Close the context when done
    await browser.close(); // Close the browser
})();

Using BrowserContexts in Playwright allows for efficient and organized testing, enabling developers to manage multiple 
user sessions and environments seamlessly. This isolation and flexibility are particularly useful for testing 
applications with varied user states or multi-user scenarios.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.How do you handle navigation and wait for elements?

To navigate to a new page, you typically use the page.goto() method. Playwright automatically waits for the page
to load before proceeding with further actions. Here’s an example:

await page.goto('https://example.com'); // Navigate to the URL

Playwright provides several methods to wait for elements to become available before interacting with them. 
Here are some common approaches:

1.Auto-Waiting: By default, Playwright waits for elements to be visible, attached to the DOM, 
and actionable before interacting with them. For example:

await page.click('button#submit'); // Automatically waits for the button to be ready

2.Explicit Waits: If you need more control, you can use explicit wait functions like waitForSelector():

await page.waitForSelector('div.alert', { state: 'visible' }); // Wait until the element is visible

3.Wait for Navigation: If an action triggers a navigation (like a form submission), you can use page.waitForNavigation() in conjunction with your action:

4.Timeouts: You can specify a timeout for waits to prevent indefinitely hanging tests:

await page.waitForSelector('div.alert', { timeout: 5000 }); // Wait with a 5-second timeout

5.Wait for Network Requests: You can wait for network requests to complete using waitForResponse() or waitForRequest():

await page.waitForResponse(response => response.url().includes('/api/data') && response.status() === 200);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.Can you explain how to take screenshots and videos in Playwright?


Sure! In Playwright, taking screenshots and recording videos of your test runs is straightforward and can be very useful for debugging and documentation. Here’s how to do both:

Taking Screenshots
You can capture screenshots at different points in your tests. Here’s how:

1.Full Page Screenshot: To capture a screenshot of the entire page:
await page.screenshot({ path: 'fullpage.png', fullPage: true });

2.Element Screenshot: To capture a screenshot of a specific element:
const element = await page.$('selector'); // Select the element
await element.screenshot({ path: 'element.png' });

3.Partial Page Screenshot: To capture a screenshot of a specific viewport:
await page.screenshot({ path: 'viewport.png' });

Create a Browser Context with Video Recording:

When creating a new context, you can specify the video options. Here’s an example:

const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const context = await browser.newContext({
        recordVideo: {
            dir: 'videos/', // Directory to save videos
            size: { width: 1280, height: 720 } // Video resolution
        }
    });
    const page = await context.newPage();

    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    // Your testing code here

    await context.close(); // Close the context to finalize the video
    await browser.close(); // Close the browser
})();
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.How do you perform assertions in Playwright?

await expect(page.locator('selector')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.locator('selector')).toHaveText('expected text');
await expect(page.locator('input')).toHaveAttribute('type', 'text');
await expect(page.locator('input')).toHaveValue('expected value');
const count = await page.locator('selector').count();
expect(count).toBeGreaterThan(0); // or any other assertion

const title = await page.title();
expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');

const heading = await page.locator('h1');
expect(await heading.isVisible()).toBe(true);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.How can you run tests in parallel using Playwright?

1. Default Parallelism
By default, Playwright Test runs tests in parallel across multiple browser contexts. Each test file runs in its own worker, 
and multiple workers can run simultaneously. This is managed automatically by Playwright.

2.Configuration
You can control parallel execution in your Playwright configuration file
workers: 4, // Adjust this number based on your machine

3.npx playwright test

4.Grouping Tests
If you want to control which tests run in parallel, you can use test.describe.parallel() to group tests that should run in parallel:

const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test.describe.parallel('Group 1', () => {
    test('Test 1', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('https://example.com');
        // Test code here
    });

    test('Test 2', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('https://example.com');
        // Test code here
    });
});

test.describe('Group 2', () => {
    test('Test 3', async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto('https://example.com');
        // This will run sequentially with other tests in Group 2
    });
});
